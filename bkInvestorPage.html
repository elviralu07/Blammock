                        Manufacturing plan is still TBD (in-house vs external manufacturer)
                        The in-house manufacturing plan would likely have a lower cost than an external
                         manufacturer at the cost of fewer units produced. The external manufacturing plan 
                         would require extensive time and effort to research, and would cost more to set up. 
                         This would be offset by the increased capacity to create units, and is something that 
                         the team will need to strongly consider going forward.

                         efficient manner. Our goal is to begin delivering our product in the Fall of 2023, 
                         which will coincide with the start of the new school year at USC. This will allow us 
                         to tap into the large and active community of outdoor enthusiasts on campus and establish a
                          strong presence in the market as students move onto campus.
                        <br><br>
                        To ensure the success of our product launch, we are working tirelessly to build brand 
                        awareness and generate interest among our target audience. We plan to leverage a range of
                        marketing channels, including social media, influencer partnerships, and on-campus events, 
                        to reach as many potential customers as possible.

                        We are also focused on achieving a positive cash flow within the first year of operations.
                        We believe that by carefully managing our costs, investing in smart marketing initiatives, 
                        and delivering a high-quality product that meets the needs of our target customers, we can 
                        achieve this goal and set ourselves up for long-term success.

                            We are also exploring opening an in-house manufacturing hub right here at USC. With this 
                            route, Blammock would hire USC tailors and seamstresses on our campus and train them to create
                            the Blammock from start to finish. Not only would this allow us to completely cut down on
                            shipping costs for USC students, but it would give us complete control over the assembly 
                            process. Any potential production issues could be more easily resolved by the team. 
                            It would also provide job opportunities for USC students and benefit the community at our
                            university.

                        Blammock is constantly evaluating our financial situation and making strategic plans 
                        to ensure our long-term success. Currently, we are in a strong financial position, with
                         no debt and no plans to sell the company.
                        <br><br>
                        However, as we continue to grow and expand our product line, we recognize the need 
                        to invest in new technologies, materials, and manufacturing processes. To that end, 
                        we plan on exploring potential deals with manufacturers that can help us increase our 
                        production capacity and improve the quality of our products.
                        <br><br>
                        While we recognize that such deals may require a significant investment of up to thousands 
                        of dollars on our part, we are confident that the long-term benefits will outweigh the 
                        short-term costs. By partnering with a manufacturer, we can reduce our production costs, 
                        increase our efficiency, and ultimately provide better value to our customers.
