            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The Blammock team was a group of six dynamic individuals - Lindsey, Campbelle, Josh, Hamin, Tyler, and Victoria. They were all tasked with the challenge of coming up with a product for a lemonade stand project, and they were determined to create something unique and exciting that would catch the attention of students.
<br>
<br>
                After a lot of brainstorming and bouncing ideas off of each other, Lindsey had an "Aha!" moment and suggested creating a multi-purpose hammock that could transform into a backpack and a blanket - and so the Blammock was born! The team was thrilled with the idea, and they quickly got to work, with Campbelle and Lindsey leading the way in figuring out the pattern and sewing the first prototype.
                <br>
                <br>                
                As they continued to develop the Blammock, each member of the team brought their own unique skills and strengths to the table. Josh came up with the perfect branding and logo design, while Hamin, Tyler, and Victoria ideated additional features that would make the Blammock even more versatile and appealing.
<br>
<br>
                Despite some setbacks and challenges along the way, the team never lost sight of their goal - to create a product that students would love and use every day. They poured their hearts and souls into the project, working late into the night and putting in countless hours of hard work and dedication. 
                <br>
                <br>
                So next time you're lounging in a Blammock, remember that it was created with love, passion, and the tireless efforts of the amazing team behind it.
